antha
=======

Initial release of the Antha language parser and cross-compiler. Note: this release is focused on the language parser, and as such does not cross compile to functional Elements.

The cmd package contains antha, anthafmt, and anthadoc, which implements the Antha Element parser, code formatting, and documentation generator respectively.
