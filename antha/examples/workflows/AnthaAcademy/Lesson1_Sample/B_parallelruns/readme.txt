antharun --driver

Antha is set up to allow you to set up various drivers which interpret the instructions compiled by antha into device specific commands for execution.

1. 
There are many additional flags which may be used with the antharun command. 
To see the full list type antharun --help on the command line.

2. 
To select which driver port to connect to add the --driver flag as shown above (making sure it matches the driver port youâ€™ve served in a separate terminal). 
By default the driver port will be localhost:50051

'antharun --driver localhost:50051'

Before running this command you need to run the driver using the following command in a separate terminal:

'PipetMax'

3. The manualLiquidhandlingdriver would work in the same way
You can get this from source code before running in a separate terminal

go get github.com/antha-lang/manualLiquidHandler

Running it:


cd server
go build ./...
./server
